			<h1>A list of things I really like in no particular order</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Free Software</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free software</a> rocks, you won't see me using propietary software unless I really have no other option, or it's contemplated under certain exceptions. I endorse free software and I believe it is a must for everyone who thinks their privacy and freedom is a priority. People not using it harm other users's rights, so we should do everything we can to endorse its adoption.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Unix-Like Operating Systems</h3>
					<p>No human creation is perfect, but Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie got really damn close to it with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> operating system. This OS was so good, that every good modern OS's design is based on it. And it was developed in 1969!!!, how can you create such a piece of art like that?, It's awesome.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>The C Programming Language</h3>
					<p>And talking about art, they were not satisfied with creating the most perfect, most simple, most artistic operating system, but created the most perfect, most simple, and most artistic programming language just to write it. They can't keep gettin' away with this!</p>
					<p>The C programming language is as close as perfect as a programming language can be, and I'm not willing to discuss it. No older nor modern lang matches its simplicity, speed and elegancy at the same time, without being a fork of it, or being strongly inspired by it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>進撃の巨人 (Attack on Titan)</h3>
					<p>I love this story, I love the characters, I love the animation, I love the music, made me laugh, made me cry, I love every aspect of it. If you haven't watched it, then what are you waiting for?, It's a once in a lifetime.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>Programming is like creating things out of thin air, when you write your first "Hello, World", and it runs, you feel like a trascendental programming entity beyond human comprehension. There was nothing, you smashed some keys on the keyboard, and then boom, there was something, how cool is that?</p>
					<p>I love the fact that the computer does exactly what you tell it to do, so when there's an error, it's probably yours 99.9% percent of the time, so when you're struggling with a bug for hours and hours, and you finally manage to figure out a solution, it all clears out, and it feels really cool. It's one of those things you have to experience it yourself. If you haven't programmed a program yet, give it a try.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Vi based editors</h3>
					<p>Really cool, historical and immeasurably influential text editors in the world of computing, you should try any of them if you have time to. They're not as hard as it might look at first glance, and they are really fun to play with. Everybody can start editing text in vi in 10 minutes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h3>Graphics Programming</h3>
					<p>This is like programming but better, you're not just creating something that didn't exist before, but you're creating a physical object, or a whole three dimensional world, inside a computer!!! Absolutely astonishing.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Decentralization</h3>
					<p>Reliance on centralized authorities when there are local/decentralized alternatives for things like fiat money or cloud computing, brings so many disadvantages that I'm too lazy to enumerate them all. Decentralization should be default when it comes to these things, and I feel like people are not paying it enough attention.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Germán Garmendia</h3>
					<p>I love this guy, what can I say, check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HolaSoyGerman">youtube videos.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>
					<p>Coolest movie ever, go watch it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Extra</h3>
